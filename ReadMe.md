Assumptions:
"Add food items to shopping basket. The program can guide the user to place the
order by selecting food items (burritos, fries, and soda) and specifying quantity.
The program allows the user to update the shopping basket (e.g., removing food
items, updating quantity) as long as the user has not checked out."

even if the user has checked out, in my program, i save the details of the order which has not been placed by the user.
